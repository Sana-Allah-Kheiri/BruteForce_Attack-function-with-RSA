# BruteForce_Attack-function-with-RSA
Simplified simulation of a brute-force attack on an RSA algorithm, meant solely for educational purposes. 
This script attempts to discover the private key by factoring the public modulus n to recover the private key which is notated here by 'd' variable.
Note: This is only feasible for small keys and serves to demonstrate the vulnerability of weak RSA keys.
